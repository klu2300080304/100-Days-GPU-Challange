   - N=8192:
     * Custom: 17706.93 GFLOPS
     * rocBLAS: 36986.97 GFLOPS
   - Custom kernel shows slight performance regression at N=8192

Execution Time Comparison
-----------------------
Matrix Size | Custom Time (ms) | rocBLAS Time (ms) | Time Ratio (Custom/rocBLAS)
-----------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------
1024       | 1.06            | 52.24            | 0.020 (Custom is 50x faster)
2048       | 1.23            | 0.62             | 1.984 (rocBLAS is 2x faster)
4096       | 7.40            | 4.00             | 1.850 (rocBLAS is 1.85x faster)
8192       | 62.09           | 29.73            | 2.088 (rocBLAS is 2.09x faster)

Time Analysis:
1. N=1024:
   - Custom kernel is dramatically faster
   - Custom takes only 1.06ms vs rocBLAS's 52.24ms
   - Excellent for real-time small matrix operations

2. N=2048-8192:
   - rocBLAS consistently faster
   - Time advantage for rocBLAS stays roughly constant at 2x
   - Both implementations show expected O(NÂ³) scaling

3. Scaling Characteristics:
   - Custom: Time increases from 1.06ms to 62.09ms (58.6x)
   - rocBLAS: Time increases from 52.24ms to 29.73ms (0.57x)
   - rocBLAS shows better time scaling with size

Performance Scaling
-----------------
Custom Kernel:
- Excellent scaling up to N=4096 (~18.5 TFLOPS)
- Slight performance drop at N=8192
- Best suited for matrices up to 4096x4096

rocBLAS:
- Consistent scaling across all sizes
- Peak performance at N=8192 (~37 TFLOPS)
- More efficient for larger matrices
